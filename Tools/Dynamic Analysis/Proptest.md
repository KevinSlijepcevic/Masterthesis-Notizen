- "_Property testing_ is a system of testing code by checking that certain properties of its output or behaviour are fulfilled for all inputs. These inputs are generated automatically, and, critically, when a failing input is found, the input is automatically reduced to a _minimal_ test case."
- Crate ist nahezu feature-complete
- Idealerweise komplementär mit regulären Unit-Tests gepaart
- Given infinite time, property testing will eventually explore the whole input space to a test. However, time is not infinite, so only a randomly sampled portion of the input space can be explored. This means that property testing is extremely unlikely to find single-value edge cases in a large space.
